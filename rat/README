RAT Tables are files that contain a list of free space.
Or in otherwords, it is a list of address ranges in which data is
overwritable.

The script inserter uses these tables to determine where to place
translated text. The address ranges are also divided into section
to control where the text goes. For the main text, it uses the
'PUBLIC' section.

Ex.
008000-008F00

will add the addresses $8000-$8F00 to the RAT table and allows
translated text to be place in this address range. But warning,
make sure there is no important data in that address range or
suffer the consequences!
