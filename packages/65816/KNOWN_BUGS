KNOWN BUGS & CAVEATS
--------------------

* you must explicitly pad banks out to 32k bytes for a .b file to be padded
	(.smc files are padded to 32k by definition)

* if you pad to a value less than you current position it will screw up
   (bug is in address_directive(); and has to do with hirom support)
		$9000	lda $>ff
		$9003	pad $1000   <---this will screw up, hirom bug 
					affecting normal code generation

* default word values, < forces byte addressing, > forces long
