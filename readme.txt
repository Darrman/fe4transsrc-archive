USAGE

If you're using an emulator with auto/soft-patching support, then give the patch the same
name as the ROM, excluding the extension.

EG: If your ROM is "fe4.smc", name the patch "fe4.ips". NOT "fe4.smc" or "fe4.smc.ips".


Alternatively you can permapatch the file with a patching program, but this is not
recommended for various reasons, the most notable of which is that you can't take the patch
off.


PROBLEMS?

This patch only works on a headered FE4 ROM. The size of the ROM should be:

4, 194, 816 bytes

If it is instead

4, 194, 304 bytes

then you have a ROM without a header and you should either find one which does, or find
a program to add a header to it for you.

Headers are unnecessary and I've considered releasing a headerless version (as opposed to
a headered version, not in addition to) but I can't be bothered at the moment.
