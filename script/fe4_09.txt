Your Highness... did you notice the dragon knight atop that mountain in Manster?[k]
[dcs]

Yeah, I did. It's not often you see a female dragon knight, even in Thracia.[k]
[cs]
Why? Was something strange about her?

[TWinBtm] # Finn
[Wait 10]
The lance she was holding was none other than the Holy Gae Bolg.[k]

[TWinTop] # Leif
Fin! What're you trying to tell me!?

She... she's alive!? Then what's she doing commanding Thracian forces?

Hmm... Trabant musn't be as cold-hearted as everybody has made him out to be.

[TWinBtm] # Finn
[Wait 10]
All is not as it seems. Between the two of you, only Princess Altenna inherited the God Noba's lineage from your father.[k]
[dcs]
Accordingly, only she can use the Gae Bolg.[k]
[cs]
And that explains why Trabant abducted her. It doesn't surprise me... a man like him.[k]
[cs]

[TWinTop] # Leif
So he's basically just using her. Trabant... you're rotten to the core![k]

Fin, we must let her know the truth! And then we can avenge our parent's death together!
