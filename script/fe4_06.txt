Harold, how's your investigation of the rebel army coming?[k]
[cs]
Don't tell me you haven't done anything yet.[k]
[cs]
Prince Shanan's rebel army gets larger each year and they're meddling with my affairs![k]
[cs]
Don't you know they're harbouring Sigurd the Traitor's son?[k]
[cs]
With them on the loose my position as King of Isaac is completely being undermined![k]
[cs]
You tell me how to explain this to His Majesty the Emperor!

[TWinBtm] # (null)
[Wait 10]
I thoroughly understand your concerns, but I have matters under control.[k]
[dcs]
We've located the rebel army's hideout, and I have already dispatched forces to subdue them.[k]
[cs]
They have nowhere to run now, so you can sit back and relax as we eliminate the threat.[k]
[cs]

[TWinTop] # (null)
Well, we'll see. But listen closely, Harold. Do not underestimate them![k]
[cs]
The problem isn't with the younger rebels, it's with Oifaye and Shanan.[k]
[cs]
You overlook those two and the complications will be far reaching!

[TWinBtm] # (null)
[Wait 10]
Yes, I understand, but I have information that both Oifaye and Shanan are presently away from the rebel hideout in Tilnanogue.[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop] # (null)
What? Then what are you waiting for!? Order your men to attack![k]
[cs]
The Isaacian citizens have made the rebel army out to be some kind of liberation army.[k]
[cs]
They're treating them like heroes! But I think it's time to teach them a little lesson.[k]
[cs]
Harold, kill every last one of them! I'll be back in Rivough awaiting your good news.[k]

[TWinTop] # Lakche
[$00$2C$32$00]! You're not scared, are you? This is our chance to see a little action.[k]

Shanan still thinks of us as kids. That's why we almost never get to fight, but we've had enough training!

There's no better place than Isaac to raise an army to take on the empire.

[TWinBtm] # Selis

Yes, the Isaacian people are very strong. And their hatred for the empire is unparalleled.[k]

Of course, things would all be that much easier if Prince Shanan was with us.[k]

15 years have passed since Lord Alvis unified the continent. The early days of the empire weren't actually all that bad.[k]
[cs]
Initially, Emperor Alvis applied constitutional law to govern the people.[k]
[cs]
It was a bit constraining, but it was a peaceful time in Judgral's history.[k]
[cs]
But several years back the emperor did a complete about-face. He became very rigid with his rule and adopted oppressive governing tactics.[k]
[cs]
Now the ominous Lopt Sect is back, and their influence has spread across the land.[k]
[cs]
Sacrificial rituals have also reappeared. Children all over are being rounded up for the resurrection of the Loptian lord.[k]
[cs]
And anyone who attempts to rise up is either enslaved or executed...[k]
[cs]
It's obvious now that they're attempting to restore the Lopt Empire.

The world is in desperate need of a saviour. And I think that you're the one, Celice.[k]

You are the only one who has the power to pull it off.

Whoa! Wait a minute! I have nothing near what it takes![k]

[TWinTop] # (null)
It's your duty, Celice. You are Empress Deirdre's firstborn son... the older brother to Prince Julius.[k]
[cs]
As a direct descendant of Saint Heim, you have an obligation to lead your crusaders and rid the world of darkness.

[dcs]

[TWinTop] # (null)
Celice, you DO have what it takes. You just don't realise it yet. You're of Baldo lineage.[k]

You'll come to realise that fate is susceptible to change. It doesn't centre on one person.[k]
[cs]
Sigurd left much behind for you. Most importantly his friends... I being one of them.[k]

You can credit your father's kindness for bringing so many good people to your side.

You'll be just fine, Celice. Okay, we need to make Lenster our next destination.[k]
[cs]
The son of your father's good friend Cuan took a stand against the government in Manster. But he is in dire need of some backup.[k]
[cs]
We can leave Isaac in the hands of the people. We'd better get moving.[k]

We'll meet up with Prince Shanan somewhere down the line.
