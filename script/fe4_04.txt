The Dark Lord Loputousu's power is evil. Only the divine power of Lord Narga could match it.[k]

It is said that all direct descendants of the Crusaders have a sacred marking appear somewhere on their body during infancy.[k]

If Prince Kurth's daughter were to bear a child, that child would become heir to the Grandbell Kingdom.[k]

That'd put the husband to be, Lord Alvis, into quite a position of power, I'd say.[k]
