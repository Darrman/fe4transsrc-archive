Well, the boy... Cigyun's son is in Barhara at the moment.[k]
[cs]
But he's of no use to us without the girl...[n]
Allow me to explain.[k]
[cs]
Cigyun was a descendant of Prince Maira who was the Loptian emperor's younger brother.[k]
[cs]
In short, Cigyun was the only surviving descendant of the Lopt Clan.[k]
[cs]
Now, Cigyun broke the Maira Decree by bearing children. You follow me, Sandima?

[TWinBtm] # Sandima
[Wait 10]
Yes. By uniting the blood of her offspring, the Dark Lord Loputousu shall be revived![k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop] # (null)
Precisely. Now in order for us, the remnants of the Lopt Empire, to once again enter the world stage, we must awaken the Dark Lord at any cost.[k]
[cs]
Sandima, you know as well as I what we've been through.[k]
[cs]
We've spent the last several hundred years in hiding deep within the Yied Desert, suffering extreme hardships, dreaming the day would come for us to rebuild the Empire.[k]
[cs]
Well, that day is now upon us!

[TWinBtm] # Sandima

Understood. I will see my mission through, even if it takes my last breath![k]

There's a dense forest jus' north of this village. T'is called th' 'Spirit Forest'.[k]

I used t'live there once upon a time in a village hidden deep within th' forest.[k]

Th' legend goes that Saint Maira was exiled by his fellow Loptian clansmen for allying with us humans.[k]

That village is where all of Maira's descendants holed up t'avoid persecution.[k]

While I was there, a beautiful girl named Cigyun was living under th' village's custody.[k]

That was due t'her bein' th' last remaining descendant of th' Loptian lord.[k]

But Cigyun grew tired of th' forest life. She up and left thus breaking village law.[k]

She returned several years later expectin' a child.[k]

She gave birth to a little girl, but tragically didn't survive.[k]
