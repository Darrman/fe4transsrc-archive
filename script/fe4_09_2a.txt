Arion! Don't you understand what you're causing Altenna to go through?[k]

Levin, does Arion still intend to fight?

We've sent several messengers calling for a truce already, but he won't listen.[k]
[dcs]
I guess the pride of being a Dragon Knight leaves no allowances for conceding in battle.[k]
[cs]
I truly believed Arion of Thracia would have been a more reasonable man...[k]
[cs]
Celice, you know we can't turn around now. We MUST engage this final battle.[k]

Grr... Why!? Why must Arion be so stubborn about this?[k]

A battalion of Dragon Knights just left Thracia. Get ready, Celice. We're going back in.

[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]
But Levin, the empire is our enemy. Is there any reason we should take on Thracia, too?[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop] # (null)
The reasons'll become apparent if you handle this properly.[k]
[cs]
This battle is already well underway, Celice. There's no going back.

[Wait 10]
But the dragon knight on that mountain top back there... She looked so sad.[k]
[dcs]
The thought of having to fight her as well...[k]

Celice! Get over it!! This is war.[k]

If you can't handle the heat, then you belong back at Tilnanogue!
