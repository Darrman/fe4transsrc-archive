Levin, Thracia's army is like nothing we've faced before.[k]

They fight with such intensity... Where does that come from?

[TWinBtm] # (null)
[Wait 10]
Well, for starters Thracia is not as well off as most countries.[k]
[dcs]
Its steep mountain ranges make agriculture just about impossible. Simply having enough food to eat is a job in and of itself.[k]
[cs]
So the men do mercenary work, and the women take whatever work they can get.[k]
[cs]
King Trabant's methods may be diabolical, but his actions aren't all personally motivated.[k]
[cs]
The soldiers of Thracia have sworn their loyalty to Trabant because they believe he is their one true emancipator.[k]

[TWinBtm] # (null)

Trabant's idea of justice quickly loses its meaning outside of Thracia.[k]

For the people living peacefully in the north, he's nothing more than a despised aggressor.[k]
[cs]
I know this is tough to make sense of, but don't let it sidetrack you from our mission...[k]

You saw the people at Alster and Conote. They cried with joy when we liberated them![k]
