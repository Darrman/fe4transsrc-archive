[Wait 10]Oifey, you made it back! How are things in the other countries?
[k]

[TWinTop] # Oifaye
[dcs]
Things are getting worse. People
all over the continent are being
oppressed. As a result, there
are uprisings popping up all over the place.
[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]So it's not just Isaac, is it...[k]
[dcs]
Oifey, there's no way we can help them, is there...
[k]
[cs]

[TWinTop] # Oifaye
Well, we just don't have the manpower to take on the empire.

[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]But Isaac's war of liberation is already under way. There's no turning back now.[k]

[TWinTop] # Oifaye
[dcs]
And we can't keep you in hiding now that your whereabouts have been leaked.[k]
[cs]
I just wish we were more prepared... But we have no choice now.

[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]Sorry that I sort of got things rolling before it was time.
[k]
[dcs]
I'm just tired of seeing the people of Isaac still suffering under Danan's rule. Please understand my reasoning, Oifey.[k]
[cs]

[TWinTop] # Oifaye
I do. Anyway, we need to move now and lay in an attack on Rivough.[k]
[cs]
We must move before the empire has a chance to send in reinforcement!
