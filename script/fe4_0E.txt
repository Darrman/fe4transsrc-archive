Oifaye, you made it back! How are things in the other countries?[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop] # Oifaye
Things are getting worse. People all over the continent are being oppressed.[k]

As a result, there are uprisings popping up all over the place.

[TWinBtm] # Selis

So it's not just Isaac, is it...[k]
[dcs]
Oifaye, there's no way we can help them, is there...[k]
[cs]

[TWinTop] # Oifaye
Well, we just don't have the manpower to take on the empire.

[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]
But Isaac's war of liberation is already under way. There's no turning back now.[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop] # Oifaye
And we can't keep you in hiding now that your whereabouts have been leaked.[k]
[cs]
I just wish we were more prepared... But we have no choice now.

[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]
Sorry that I sort of got things rolling before it was time.[k]
[dcs]
I'm just tired of seeing the people of Isaac still suffering under Danan's rule. Please understand my reasoning, Oifaye.[k]
[cs]

[TWinTop] # Oifaye
I do. Anyway, we need to move now and lay in an attack on Rivough.[k]
[cs]
We must move before the empire has a chance to send in reinforcements![k]

[$00$2C$38$00]...[n]
You really mean that?

[TWinBtm] # Arthur

Of course I do. Once this war finishes, you and I are moving back to Silesia.[k]
