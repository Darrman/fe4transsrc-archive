[TWinBtm] # Arvis
[Wait 10]Your Majesty. Please, I'll explain once more. Lord Vylon assassinated the prince with the help of Lord Ring of Jungby.[k]
[dcs]
Duke Reptor and Duke Langobalt both witnessed the entire horrible spectacle![k]
[cs]
The prince learned of their plot to usurp the throne, and that cost him his life.[k]
[cs]
Sir Siglud is also without a doubt involved in the conspiracy.
[k]
[cs]
Why else would he harbor the prince of a hostile country? Isaac no less.
[k]
[cs]
These are clearly acts of treason against the kingdom.
[k]

The late Prince Kult is also now a father-in-law to me...
[k]

And for my beloved princess, Diadora, I must put an end to Siglud's path of destruction![k]

the Royal Palace to announce 
your wedding intentions, I tell

[cs]
Lord Alvis, you understand what this all means, don't you?
[k]
[cs]
According to the 
Book of Narga only 
descendants of Heim, like 
myself, can give off that 
kind of vibration.[k]
[cs]
And Narga's power is the only one capable of standing up to the Dark Lord Loputousu.

[TWinBtm] # Arvis

[k]
[cs]
And once I pass on he'll become the King of Grandbell.
[k]
[cs]
Lord Alvis, until the boy is old 
enough to rule, you shall be the 
provisional king. Do raise him 
well.[k]
