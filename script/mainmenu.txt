# This file was added by Dark Twilkitri

# This file is used for altering the text in the main menu.
# There were several unused options (copying, et al) and Linux has corrupted them.
# It doesn't really matter since they're not used, but they're in the file for completeness.
# It's probably best to leave them commented out.
