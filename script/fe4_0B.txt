He was of no use to us any more. The rebel army did us a favour by removing him.[k]

The final holy war is just about under way, Celice.

[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]
Holy war?[n]
So this is it, huh...[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop] # (null)
Yeah... Julius turned out to be a descendant of the Lopt Clan. He's been plotting to restore the dark empire from day one.[k]
[cs]
We've got to stop him... no matter what!

[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]
Levin, how do you always seem to know everything?[k]
[dcs]
Please... you gotta let me know what else is going on here![k]
[cs]

[TWinTop] # (null)
Celice, I apologise if I've kept some things from you in the past.[k]
[cs]
In all my years of travel in search of the truth, I've finally stumbled upon something big.

[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]
What is it?[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop] # (null)
Legend has it Bishop Galle crossed the sea in his youth and traveled the world before founding the Lopt Empire.[k]
[cs]
He was determined to drink the lifeblood of a legendary creature of the time.[k]
[cs]
One sip promised powers of unimaginable proportions.

[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]
You don't mean the blood of the Ancient Dragon Tribe!? That's all superstition, right?[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop] # (null)
Yeah, but when Galle returned from his travels, he possessed unexplainable powers.[k]
[cs]
He used his new powers to influence the young to his own devices.[k]
[cs]
Before long he had built up a demonic legion of warriors that followed his every whim.

[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]
So where does Lord Loputousu fit into all this?[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop] # (null)
He was most likely of the Dragon Tribe. Their blood flows in all of Galle's descendants, making the Lopt Clan's evil power and the Dragon Tribe's power one and the same.

[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]
Then what of our ancestors, the Crusaders? How did they come to be?[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop] # (null)
Well, the legend goes that the gods descended upon 12 warriors of the liberation army.[k]
[cs]
It all took place at Darna Fortress.[n]
But, um...

[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]
But what? What happened!?[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop] # (null)

What a disgrace... It's hard to believe the Dozels are of Crusader lineage.[k]
[cs]
This all started because of Langbart...

[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]
Levin, tell me more about the source of the Crusader's power. I mean... who are the gods anyway?[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop] # (null)
Here's how I understand it...[k]
[cs]
There were beings from another world who knew the Dragon Tribe's power was responsible for Jugdral's unrest.[k]
[cs]
So they came from their world to assist us.[k]
[cs]
They were the ones who appeared at Darna Fortress just as it was about to fall.

[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]
That's the 'Descent of Lord Narga and the 11 Gods' from scripture, huh...[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop] # (null)
That's right. They all assumed human forms. Narga, the god of light, appeared as a young maiden, and the fire god Salamand was that of an elderly man.[k]
[cs]
Each god performed blood rites with one of the 12 chosen warriors.

[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]
Blood rites?[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop] # (null)
Yes. After making a small cut on their fingertip, they offered their blood to the warriors.

[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]
...!?[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop] # (null)
Celice, I'll just cut to the chase. The gods you and I know from scripture are of the same Dragon Tribe as Loputousu is.[k]
[cs]
So the warriors ingested the blood of the Dragon Tribe and were reborn as the Crusaders.[k]
[cs]
Each Crusader received a weapon sealed with the power of their respective tribesmen.[k]
[cs]
After imparting a few precepts upon the Crusaders, the tribesmen left.

[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]
Wow... so that's where our power comes from![k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop] # (null)
Yet Loputousu's clan wields the most diabolic power of the entire tribe.[k]
[cs]
King Narga passed his own blood onto the leader of the liberation army, Bishop Heim.[k]
[cs]
That was Narga's only hope to rival the Loptian power.

[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]
Couldn't any of the other tribesmen take on Loputousu?[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop] # (null)
Doesn't seem likely. Even with all their power combined, they'd still need Narga's.[k]
[cs]
Now, Empress Deirdre's children are the only surviving descendants of Heim who would have inherited Narga's power...[k]
[cs]
But neither you nor Julius inherited the blood of Narga. But I now know who did.[k]
[cs]
Julius' twin sister... Princess Julia did. She's the one!

[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]
E, excuse me!?[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop] # (null)
The connection kinda threw me at first, too. But, yeah, you've got a sister, Celice.

[TWinBtm] # Selis
[Wait 10]
Julia's my sister...[n]
Geez, I never would've thought...[k]
