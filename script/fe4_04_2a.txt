Lord Levin, Rahna is very happy for you despite her attitude.[k]
[cs]
She's been so cheerful ever since you returned...
[Wait 10]

[TWinBtm]
Thank you, Mahnya. You have my gratitude. Take care of mother for me, alright?[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop]
Yes, of course. As the flightleader of the Silesian Pegasus Knights, I will guard her with my life.
[Wait 10]

[TWinBtm]
Thank you.[n]
Also... are you going to leave Fury here?[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop]
Yes... I ask that you keep her at your side. She...

Oh, Fury. You were there?
[Wait 10]

[TWinBtm]
Don't tell Lord Levin any more than necessary...[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop]
Oh... Sorry, you're right. I should have kept quiet.[k]
[cs]
Fury, I'm returning to Silesia with Lady Rahna. So make sure you protect Lord Levin, alright?[k]
[cs]

[TWinBtm]
I know, Mahnya...[k]

Mother![k]
[cs]
You talk for hours with Sigurd, but you won't even spare one moment for your own son?[k]
[cs]

[TWinTop]
My son left me two years ago and ran off to some faraway place. I don't see him anywhere.
[Wait 10]

[TWinBtm]
Ah... you're still mad?[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop]
You have no idea how worried and saddened I was![k]
[cs]

[TWinBtm]
I had my reasons, mother.[k]
[dcs]
But since I've come home in one piece, will you please forgive me?[k]
[cs]
I'll make up for the time I was gone. I know, do you want me to massage your shoulders for you?[k]
[cs]

[TWinTop]
Why, I never! Treating me like an old lady...[k]
[cs]
Levin, I have much to tell you. Come to Silesia. Soon. Understood?

Sir, Lady Rahna is here.
[Wait 10]

[TWinBtm]She is?[k]

[DlgOpn]['Rahna' 0284]
Lord Sigurd, how is life in Sailane? Have you gotten used to it yet?
[Wait 10]

[TWinBtm]
Yes. I truly appreciate your hospitality, Lady Rahna.[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop]
I know it must be uncomfortable in such a small castle, but please bear it a little longer...[k]
[cs]
I have been writing letters explaining your innocence to King Azmur, but he has yet to respond.[k]
[cs]

[TWinBtm]
That's... Prime Minister Reptor has probably been hiding them. I'm sure it's he who tricked my father...[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop]
Lord Sigurd... I understand how you feel, but you must not hold grudges against people like that.[k]
[cs]
Hate will bring you nothing. I promise you I will think of something, so until then...
[Wait 10]

[TWinBtm]
Yes...[n]
I really don't know how to thank you.[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop]
Don't worry about it.[k]
[cs]
Oh, one more thing. Something good has happened in Grandbell.
[Wait 10]

[TWinBtm]
Something good?[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop]
Yes. After being missing for so long, Prince Kurth's daughter has turned up.[k]
[cs]
The entire country is bursting with joy.
[Wait 10]

[TWinBtm]
What? ...Really!?[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop]
King Azmur recognised her at once.[k]
[cs]
She has the symbol of Narga, so she is indeed part of the royal family.
[Wait 10]

[TWinBtm]
I see...[n]
Good. The royal heritage won't die out...[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop]
Also, the princess is apparently in a relationship with Lord Alvis.[k]
[cs]
The King has approved their marraige, and there is to be a grand wedding soon.
[Wait 10]

[TWinBtm]
With Lord Alvis?[k]
[dcs]

[TWinTop]
Everyone is saying they look perfect together, Lord Sigurd. It's nice to be young, isn't it?[k]
[cs]
You... oh... I'm sorry, Lord Sigurd. Your wife...
[Wait 10]

[TWinBtm]
Deirdre... she's still gone...[k]
[dcs]
It's already been over a year. Celice has grown so much, but I still can't show him to her...[k]
[cs]

[TWinTop]
Lord Sigurd, I'm sure you'll find her. So...
[Wait 10]

[TWinBtm]
Yes, I know...[k]
[dcs]
I know that I will find her some day...[n]
I just know it.[k]

[TWinBtm][DlgOpn]['Sigurd' 0001]

[TWinTop]
Oh, yes. We should be going soon...[n]
One more thing, Lord Sigurd.[k]
[cs]
Please be wary of Duke Maios of Thove. He has had his eye on Sailane for some time.[k]
[cs]
He may go so far as to attack you. We would offer you troops, but...
[Wait 10]

[TWinBtm]
...Silesia needs to be protected in case of attack by Duke Daccar of Zaxon.[k]
[dcs]
Do not concern yourself with our protection. We can deal with any attacks by Thove's army.[k]
[cs]

[TWinTop]
Well, you are a veteran of many battles.[k]
[cs]
It has been good speaking with you, Lord Sigurd.
[Wait 10]

[TWinBtm]
Lady Rahna, it's been a pleasure.[k]

The drawbridge over Thove River is under the control of Lord Maios.[k]
[cs]
If it's not down, and you don't have a key, you're not getting across.[k]

But I bet if you had someone handy along like a thief, you might be able get it down.[k]
